# Procedure

The experiment consists of three sub-experiments. The user is recommended to go through these in the same sequence as they are presented. 

0. Dimension of linear block code and its rate. 
    * Given generator matrix and/or parity check matrix, write down the dimension of the code and its rate. 
1. Encoding
    * For given generator matrix of the linear code, learn how to encode a message vector  
2. Learn how to calculate minimum distance.
    * For given generator matrix, calculate all codewords and the minimum weight. 
3. Learn how to compute parity check matrix, given generator matrix in systematic form. 
    * Compute the two blocks $I_{n-k}$ and $P^T$ and the overall structure of the parity check matrix.  
4. Learn to identify the codewords
    * Given parity check matrix, check if given vector is a codeword or not.
